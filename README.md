# Skyl-OS an experimental OS

*Since [documentation](/docs/) exists the README file will not cover anything in depth. Also, note that since this a learning project for most of the contributors, the documentation shall generally be kept as detailed as possible.*

## Why Skyl-OS

Skyl-OS is intended to be an experimental operating system. Its main purpose is for a bunch of geeky and interested university students to learn how OS development works. 
They say explaining something is the best way to understand how well you know it anyway; so what's a better way to learn something than to explain it to a C compiler?

## How to use

Run ```make clean``` to clear previous builds.
Run ```make``` to build.
Run ```make run``` to...well, run.
