# Start Contributing

To ensure consistency among contributors we are using a **docker-based** approach.
In this document I will hold your hand through the development environment set-up process.

## 1. Downloading Docker

Docker will make sure all developers share the same version of the same tools installed on their machines. 
Doing this is a good practice that ensures reproducability and consistency. [Here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) is a downlaod link.

We will not conduct a thorough docker tutorial so you can feel free to mess arround with the docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).
